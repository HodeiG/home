! Get current keys: xmodmap -pke > ~/xmodmap
! I want to remap some keys to work in a different way.
! For this, first I have to change the modifier keys
! (special keys that can be held at the same time
! to modify its output). Example: Ctrl+C
! Use xmodmap to see modifiers.
! Use xev to see keycodes and keysyms

! Add Windows key to Control modifier
remove mod4 = Super_L
add mod1 = Super_L
! Remove Alt_L from Control modifier, because I'm
! not using it any longer as a Control key
! and map it to Switch_mode
remove mod1 = Alt_L
keycode 64 = Mode_switch
! The keycode command maps a KeyCode to a number of KeySyms. The order
! of the KeySyms is important as it represents how the KeySyms are
! derived.
! 	1. The key pressed alone
! 	2. With the Shift modifier
! 	3. The key pressed along with the Mode_switch key
! 	4. With Mode_switch AND Shift
keycode 43 = h H Left
keycode 44 = j J Down 
keycode 45 = k K Up
keycode 46 = l L Right
keycode 13 = 4 dollar End
keycode 19 = 0 equal Home
keycode 39 = s S Delete
keycode 40 = d D BackSpace
keycode 41 = f F Escape
